# Drupal Community Cluj

This project is made in order to create a website usefull for Drupal Community from Cluj Napoca. The website will contains 3 parts:
      First(The Registration): where all the people who are eager to learn Drupal are kindly invited to make an account and welcome to this magic world.
      Second(The Community Part): here people who want to share something interesting can upload the articles and also this one can help others
      The last one(Event Planer): here it will be a calender where people will be able to see the upcoming events( meetups, sprints, etc.) with the dates and locations,too.

## How to install

For this website we will use a custom theme which is derivated from the free theme: [BusinessGroup Zymphonies Group](https://www.drupal.org/project/businessgroup_zymphonies_theme).

For managing site dependencies we use:  [Composer](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project).

In order to take this project you need to follow this steps:

  * $git clone git@github.com:danielpopdan/drupal-community-cluj.git

     This is to bring this project on local.

  * $ composer install

     You need to run this command in order to download the project's dependencies.

After all this you will have the core and the contrib files as well even if these are in the [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) :
